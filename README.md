# RestAPISpringBootDemo

Maven is downloadable as a zip file at https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi. Only the binaries are required, so look for the link to apache-maven-{version}-bin.zip or apache-maven-{version}-bin.tar.gz.
Once you have downloaded the zip file, unzip it to your computer. Then add the bin folder to your path.

To run: 

$mvn clean package
\n $java -jar target/gs-rest-service-0.1.0.jar
